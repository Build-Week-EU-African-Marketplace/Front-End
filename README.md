# Front-End

# PROPOSAL

The project was inspired by the need to empower small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. We are to build a platform that enable these business owners to create listing items for sale.
MISSION STATEMENT - Empowering African women to come out of poverty

# FEATURES
The app contains one user type - An admin who can create and delete data on the platform; item name, description, price.
A home-page that displays the listings.
Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
Item page: Accessed from the home page, non-logged in users can view the list of items created by the admins

# DESIGN - PLANNING
- Create separate branches for each feature
- Display data from the API
- App to be managed using redux
- Utilize semantic UI for almost all components

# STRETCH (If time allows)
- Location based identification
- Notifications for every new item
